# Lightning Futures Exchange Client

This is the readme file for the lighning futures exchange client.

To setup the client you will need to configure a folder to specify where the client should connect to your lightning node.  You will do this in config.js.

To run the client you must install nodejs on your machine and then spin up the server.  You can then use a regular web browser and connect to it through localhost:6666 by default.  You can change the default access point in the file config.js.
